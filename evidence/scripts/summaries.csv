"Aberfeldy","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfeldy,_Victoria","Aberfeldy is a small town in Victoria, Australia on Mount Lookout, northeast of the Thomson Dam, 125 kilometres (78 mi) east of Melbourne.
The area was settled in 1871 following the discovery of gold.
The first Post Office opened on 1 January 1872  but later closed in 1967.
The town was surveyed and proclaimed in 1885. It was initially known as Mount Lookout but was eventually renamed after the Scottish town of Aberfeldy. At its peak, the township had a population of around 500. After the gold rush the town was used for sheep and cattle grazing and for the production of potatoes and other crops.
Following the First World War, the population diminished although the town managed to survive. The town hotel was burned down in 1938 and the Black Friday bush-fires of 1939 destroyed many of the buildings in the town. A road was built to Matlock by 1950 but it was not maintained properly and fell to ruin.
The town was home to Kitty Cane, a former dancer and mining investor who owned a successful shanty on Walhalla-Wood's Point Road. When Cane died, her loyal customers and the local miners decided to carry her coffin to the Aberfeldy cemetery. Since Cane was an unusually large woman and because the miners were intoxicated, the coffin never made it to the cemetery and instead the miners buried her alongside the road. When travelling from The Thomson Dam to Aberfeldy, Kitty Cane's grave is about 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) after the Cast Iron Point lookout and on the left hand side of the road.
Today there is only one permanent resident, historian Grahame Code (who has lived in the area for 50 years), and his family, although there is several holiday homes which are occupied on some weekends, land was released for public sale in 1999. Remains of former buildings are still visible.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/BigBellHotel2009.jpg","Aberfeldy.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/BigBellHotel2009.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Aberfeldy_Walhalla_Road.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/VIC_in_Australia_map.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Australia_Victoria_Shire_of_Baw_Baw_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg']",

"Adelaide Lead","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Lead,_Victoria","Adelaide Lead is a district in Victoria, Australia, site of a former settlement, located on Old Avoca Road, south-west of Maryborough, west of the Paddy Ranges State Park, in the Shire of Central Goldfields. Located on the northern slopes of the Central Highlands, 225 metres above sea level, the area is naturally characterised by Box-Ironbark forest. Remnants of aboriginal settlement include rock wells beside the Possum Gully Road.
Adelaide Lead began as a mining settlement, and covered about 3 miles (4.8 km) along the banks of Timor Creek. A state school operated from 1863 to 1954. The building, which still stands, was later used as a community hall in which Saturday night 'old time' dances were held until the late 1970s.
The area was in the eastern part of the Glenmona Pastoral Station, taken up by Isaac Moorson and Edmund McNeill in 1839 and officially established as Glenmona by Edmund McNeill and Charles Hall in 1845. In 1848 Glenmona controlled 62,080 acres (251.2 km2), grazing 12,000 sheep and 150 cattle. It was the second largest property in the area, centred on the Bet Bet Creek which provided permanent water. The property was owned by the Mills family from 1875 until 1995. When the property was sold in 1995 it comprised 1182 acres (478 hectares).
Gold was officially first discovered at Adelaide Lead in December 1854. Adelaide Lead is close to Daisy Hill where a shepherd on Glenmona station had discovered gold in 1848 and sold it in Melbourne. This discovery gained media attention, but pastoralists tried to keep any finds quiet for fear of the impact on their runs. Gold was again discovered at Daisy Hill in June 1852 and brought many prospectors into the area.
A major gold rush to Maryborough occurred from June 1854, although some miners had been working in the area from the previous December. The population grew from 150 to 1,300 in that month and from 7,000 to 20,000 in August 1854.
Three men, one of whom was William Howard, were camped on their way to the rush at Daisy Hill and found gold at Opossum Gully. As Howard came from Adelaide, he named the location Adelaide Lead.
The Adelaide Lead began as a rush of 60 diggers who pegged all of Opossum Gully. The lead was part of a long string of leads which stretched from north of Amherst through Opossum Gully in the south and via the Inkerman Lead to Alma, seven miles (11 km) to the north. The lead followed Timor Creek on the east side. There were two hotels – the Adelaide Hotel and the Junction Hotel and a Camp was established in July 1855 under the control of Phillip Champion de Crespigny, the gold commissioner appointed to oversee the Amherst gold district.
The Adelaide Lead goldfields were just a small part of a huge goldfield with very significant yields and large numbers of miners following the latest gold discoveries. Adelaide Lead was never formally gazetted as a township, it was only a postal district. At that time there were several other gazetted townships close by such as Amherst and Alma.
The initial gold discoveries were alluvial and a series of new finds and rushes opened up over seven miles (11 km) of rich alluvial field from Daisy Hill to Alma. The depth of the main lead was 70 feet (21 m). New ground continued to be discovered throughout the 50s. In1858 it was reported that up to 8 ounces of gold was recovered from a load of wash dirt (60 buckets). In March 1858 the Maryborough and District Advertiser reported that 9 oz of gold was gained from a load of wash dirt at Adelaide Lead. On 12 October 1858 a 22 oz nugget was reported as found at Adelaide Lead. A 25oz nugget was found at Adelaide Lead in June 1862. In October 1869 a 160oz nugget was found by Thomas Mole at a depth of 25feet.
The population fluctuated enormously in the gold rushes and reached over 6000 at one stage. Sometimes the population of the area was mainly Chinese diggers. In October 1855 there were three encampments of Chinese at Adelaide Lead, which were visited by Bernhard Smith, Acting Gold Receiver at Amherst, who had been made Protector to watch over the interests of the Chinese.
After the initial rush in 1855, numbers of miners at Adelaide Lead fluctuated and declined as the surface alluvial gold was exhausted. In 1860 the Croydon Reef was discovered and quartz mining commenced. The Croydon Reef mine yielded 26,000 oz of gold and the Federal Reef mine 5,000 oz. However, there were very few large deep lead mines in the area, unlike Talbot, Alma and Timor.
Prospectors remained in the district for many years, working the alluvial gullies and reefs. However discovery of gold in Western Australia later in the nineteenth century saw some of these miners move west.
The lack of permanent water in the area was a problem for both miners and farmers who took up the small blocks of land. The Timor Creek only flowed after rain and residents depended on wells, tanks and small dams.
Reports in a range of official documents record the following population numbers at Adelaide Lead: 1855 (June)- 6000, 1858 (Aug)- 2000, 1859 - 1055, 1861 - 405  1865 - 600  1923 - less than 100, 1974 - 50.
The 1861 Census return for Adelaide Lead, Blutchers Reef and adjoining gold workings showed a total population of 405 (275 males and 130 females). Only 100 people were born in Victoria, with 169 born in England, 41 in Scotland and 24 in Ireland. 35 were born in Germany. This census listed no people from China. The census listed occupations: 207 men engaged in alluvial sinking, 30 in gold puddling, 45 as diggers undefined, 10 in quartz crushing amalgam and gold quartz raising, 5 in trading, 5 carters, 2 labourers, 3 food and drinks, 184 domestics or children (58 male, 126 female). There were 107 children from 0 to 9 years, with 110 men and 34 women aged 25 to 34 years.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Ad.Lead_Railway_Station.jpg","Adelaide Lead.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Ad.Lead_Railway_Station.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/David%26Eliza%2C_Adelaide_Lead_-_abt.1895.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Adelaide_Lead_Post_Office_circa_1950.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Australia_Victoria_Central_Goldfields_Shire_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",

"Amherst","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst,_Victoria","Amherst a town in Victoria, Australia is now located in what is known as the Shire of Central Goldfields, northwest of Talbot. The town's location now resembles an uneven paddock of some 10 acres (40,000 m2), but has little showing of its startling and significant historical prevalence. The town began as a mining settlement which was referred to as Daisy Hill, or sometimes Daisy Hill Creek, and extended throughout the village. After a discovery of gold during the Gold Rush of 1853, the location became known as an extremely rich goldfield soon thereafter. Prior to this discovery, Daisy Hill had gained a particular notoriety, due to an illegal gold rush in February 1849, that was based solely upon the spurious claims made by on Thomas ""Tommy"" Chapman, a shepherd and former Parkhurst prison delinquent. It has been said that Chapman sold a gold nugget substantial in size, and relative to that of an adult hand, to a Melbourne Jeweller, Mr. Bretani from Collins Street. Soon after this alleged sale, Chapman mysteriously vanished. Much confusion surrounds where Chapman actually found the nugget, or if in fact, he stole it, according to the March 1849 issue of the Maitland Chronicle newspaper. As for his disappearance, a number of shepherds used the alias of Thomas Chapman.
The two principal colonial towns of Geelong and Melbourne were involved in the gold fever hype, since the California rush had also started, with the discovery of Daisy Hill, as was reported in local newspapers between February and March 1849. Because the actual location of Daisy Hill is still unknown, it often gets confused with a land division nearby in the Paddy Ranges known as the Daisy Hill Block, which was an earlier squatter survey lease in the Pyrenees. In addition to this, the Colonial Police Troopers were stationed at a place that had been widely known to be to referred to as Daisy Hill in 1849, which is located on the highway to Maryborough. However, newspapers of the period often loosely referred to Cluned Station, some 10 miles (16 km) east as the ""Pyrenees"".
The village name actually comes from a mining camp which saw tens of thousands of miners rush the area, and changed the name from Daisy Hill to Amherst in 1855, after the area was surveyed. With a Post Office opening in January 1856, (closed 1963), Amherst eventually became a municipality in 1858, which included the town of Talbot (formerly known as Back Creek, for rioting miners in 1855).
Talbot increased in size and eventually replaced Amherst as the municipality. Much of the original township has been destroyed by bushfire, and little remains other than the Amherst Cemetery. Due to years of isolation, time stood still for Talbot as it exhibits the charm of restored buildings dating back to its thriving heyday.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/AmherstCemetery.JPG","Amherst.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/AmherstCemetery.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Australia_Victoria_Central_Goldfields_Shire_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",

Whilst both Westgarth and Thornbury each have their own distinct central hub, unlike Westgarth, the majority of Thornbury is too far away from its centre for the whole of Thornbury to ever be able to develop its own separate identity.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Thornbury%2C_Victoria_pronunciation.ogg","Thornbury.ogg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Thornbury%2C_Victoria_pronunciation.ogg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Australia_Victoria_metropolitan_Melbourne_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg']",

The township and surrounding rural community are located on the southern extremity of a range of Silurian slate and sandstone rock. The area was a centre of intensive gold mining in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The township was known as Kangaroo prior to 1900, the Post Office opening in January 1878 as Kangaroo, being renamed Berringa in 1900 and closing in 1955. Gold has been mined at Berringa since the 1850s, with the main period of production being from 1898 to 1917, during which time about 280,000 ounces of gold were extracted from five major mines and several other, smaller operations. Mining continued after World War I on a lesser scale until the area was abandoned in the 1950s.
Ballarat Goldfields NL, through its subsidiary, Berringa Resources Pty. Ltd., still conducts exploration operations at Berringa.
Gold mining had a direct effect on Berringa's population, which increased from 150 in 1899 to a peak of about 4000 in 1908. By 1922, with the gold mining boom over, the population had fallen to about 100. As of the 2006 census, Berringa and the surrounding area had a population of 259. The Berringa district is showing a modest population revival with the tree change phenomenon.

The town is at one end of the Grand Ridge Rail Trail, which travels for 13 kilometres through temperate rainforest and dry sclerophyll forest in the Strzelecki Ranges. The original railway branch line from Morwell to Boolarra, was opened on 10 April 1885, with the last train being run on 22 June 1974. The railway was constructed through difficult hilly terrain requiring construction of massive embankments and numerous bridges.
The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mid Gippsland Football League.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/BoolaraBridge.jpg","Boolarra.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/BoolaraBridge.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Australia_Victoria_Latrobe_City_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",

Bridgewater has a new swimming pool and beach about two minutes walk from the Loddon Bridge Hotel, opposite the Post Office.
When reasonable water levels flow, the Mill Rapid downstream of the Calder Hwy bridge provides technical whitewater kayaking of Grade 3 standard featuring a short fast run. This should only be attempted by kayakers with an appropriate level of experience and training and equipped at the very least with spray covers, buoyancy vests and helmets. Access is usually via local roads on the west bank. If approaching on the water from upstream, beware of entering the flour mill race area on the right (east) bank.

It is bounded on the south by Loughnan, Warrandyte and Wonga Roads (these roads flow into one and other continuously). Glenvale Road forms the western most boundary in the southern part of the suburb, with the Warrandyte-Ringwood Road forming the western boundary at the northern end of the suburb. The eastern and northern boundaries follow property lines, rather than roads.
Ringwood North Post Office opened on 9 August 1920, in the then rural area.
Ringwood North has its own shopping centre and also has plenty of parklands and reserves nearby without being excessively rural, like Wonga Park or Warrandyte. Its roads feature a happy medium between the sterile, parallel streetscapes of Ringwood and the circular, 'contour-line' style streets found in neighbouring Park Orchards.
Ringwood North is a surprisingly hilly area, which is especially evident around the aptly named Loughnan's Hill area and the infamously steep Glenvale Road. Glenvale Road also happens to mark the boundary between Ringwood North and Donvale and also the boundary between Maroondah and Manningham. It was the scene of a rather major car accident several years ago, in which a Holden HQ one-tonne utility carrying a large load of bricks overturned upon making its descent.

The name is believed to have been derived from George Jamieson, a shepherd who grazed sheep in the area in the 1850s. At the time of the 2011 census, Jamieson had a population of 384.
The area was first settled in 1860 and by 1861 there were approximately 300 people working the goldfields. The Post Office opened on 18 January 1858.
The town site was surveyed in 1862, and a borough council was established in 1864. By 1865 the town had a Catholic chapel, an Anglican church, a school, a court house and police station, two banks, two insurance offices, five hotels and several stores. Jamieson reached its peak in the 1870s, but a sharp decline soon followed. Most mining operations had ceased by the beginning of the First World War, and Black Friday bushfires destroyed many mine workings in 1939.
By the 1990s, the town had become a popular tourist destination, boosted by Lake Eildon (situated adjacent to the Jamieson township and formed by the damming of the Goulburn River) reaching 100% capacity in 1996. However the tourism industry suffered in the early 2000s following a drought which affected Lake Eildon. The drought has proven to be long term and in March 2007, the capacity of the lake reached a historic low of 7.9%.
Today, Jamieson has a permanent population of around 250. It is a popular destination for four wheel drive enthusiasts, fishers, and amateur gold diggers. It is close to Lake Eildon and the Mount Buller snowfields.

"Docklands","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docklands,_Victoria","Docklands (also known as Melbourne Docklands to differentiate it from London Docklands) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 2 km (1.2 mi) west of Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the City of Melbourne. At the 2011 Census, Docklands had a population of 5,791.
Docklands occupies an area adjacent to the Melbourne CBD. It is bounded by Wurundjeri Way and the Charles Grimes Bridge to the east, CityLink to the west and Lorimer Street across the Yarra to the south and is a primarily waterfront area centred on the banks of the Yarra River.
Contemporary Docklands is the product of an ongoing urban renewal project to extend the area of the Melbourne CBD (excluding Southbank and St Kilda Road) by over a third when completed around 2015. It is now home to several of Melbourne's modern landmarks, including Etihad Stadium and the Melbourne Star Ferris wheel.
From the 1880s, the former swamp west of Melbourne became heavily used as a dock, with an extensive network of wharfs, heavy rail infrastructure and light industry. However, following the containerisation of shipping traffic it fell into disuse and by the 1990s was virtually abandoned, becoming notable for an underground rave dance scene, a dance culture which survives through popular organised events held at Docklands Stadium.
Docklands Stadium was built in 1996 as a centrepiece to kick-start developer interest in Docklands as a viable renewal area. Urban renewal began in earnest 2000, with several independent privately developed areas overseen by VicUrban, an agency of the State government of Victoria. The brief for the master plan was for wide open water promenades and road boulevards with contributions of landscaping and public art commissions to be made by each developer and construction was to adhere to strict milestones. VicUrban promotes its vision of Docklands as being a major tourist attraction and projected over 20 million visitors a year and a future (2015) residential population of over 20,000.
A handful of significant buildings were retained, generally due to their association with the area's industrial and maritime history. Most of these heritage buildings are intended for adaptive reuse and integrated with new facilities.
Docklands has become a sought-after business address, attracting the national headquarters of the National Australia Bank, ANZ, Medibank Private, Bureau of Meteorology, Myer, National Foods as well as the regional headquarters for Ericsson and Bendigo Bank. The business park model of medium-rise office buildings combined with transport and proximity to the City Centre is seen by many in the real estate industry to be one of the reasons behind the success of the Docklands office market.
Docklands is also the home to a number of water sports, including Dragon Boat racing.
While still incomplete, Docklands developer-centric planning has been widely criticised and many Melbourne politicians and media commentators lament its lack of green open space, pedestrian activity, transport links and culture.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Melbourne_Docklands_-_Yarras_Edge_-_marina_panorama.jpg","Docklands.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Melbourne_Docklands_-_Yarras_Edge_-_marina_panorama.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Telstra_Dome_08.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Web_Bridge_in_Docklands.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Etihad_Stadium_crop.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Victoria_Harbour_Offices_at_Night.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Melbourne_docklands_area.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Melbourne_from_Waterfront_City%2C_Docklands_Pano%2C_20.07.06.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Victoria_Point_Docklands.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Mlb_docklands_from_etihad.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Docklands_of_Melbourne.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Spencer_street_station_1889.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Port1010DigitalHarbour.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/Victoria_docks_melbourne_in_the_1920s.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/The_Age_Collins_St_2010.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Docklands_Stadium%2C_Melbourne%2C_Christmas_1998.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/ANZ_Docklands.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Batmans_hill_1840_and_1892.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Waterfront_city_studio_lane.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Southern-cross-station-melbourne-morning.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Kylie_minogue_statue_at_waterfront_city.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/After_1892.PNG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Before_1880.PNG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Flag_of_Melbourne.PNG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Australia_Victoria_metropolitan_Melbourne_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg']",

The area lies east of the township of Melton and west of the suburb of Caroline Springs. The land contains many large volcanic rocks making it poor for cultivating crops. The rocks have been used to build walls between paddocks - characteristic of the area west of Melbourne. Mount Cottrell is the highest land point in the vicinity.
The railway station is on the Melton line. Rockbank is also served by the Route 456 bus that runs along the Western Freeway, linking Melton and Sunshine.
The rich, red volcanic soil in the area has helped build the reputation of local wineries. Rockbank is also the host to Victoria's Annual Olive Festival. The earlier agricultural activities date back to the pastoral exploits of William Cross Yuille on the plains.
The town has an Australian rules football team, competing in the Riddell District Football League. Koori Elder Steven Hanning also play for the side and are respected elders of the Rockbank community.

Melton began as a small town before being declared a satellite city in 1974, separated from Melbourne's urban area by a green wedge. Since the 1990s it experienced rapid suburban growth into surrounding greenfield land and become a commuter town in the Melbourne-Ballarat growth corridor. Changes to Melbourne's urban growth boundary passed by the state government in 2010 effectively relinquish its satellite city status as it is planned to become part of Melbourne's future conurbation.
It is named after Melton Mowbray in the United Kingdom.

The park is a protected area of 1,130 square kilometres (436 sq mi), with no vehicular access, and no defined walking tracks. Encompassing part of the Big Desert, it also adjoins Ninety Mile Desert across the border in South Australia. As the park is a dedicated wilderness area, there are no facilities of any kind, including toilets or campsites. However, hiking and small fuel stoves are permitted. The park is part of the Wyperfeld, Big Desert and Ngarkat Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of malleefowl and other species of mallee birds.[2]

A large bushfire was ignited by lightning in the park in 2002 then spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry fuel. The fire soon joined another in the adjoining Wyperfield National Park and an area of 1,814 square kilometres (700 sq mi) was burned out.

Hotels, a post office (opened on 7 September 1878), schools and churches followed and Nathalia was officially gazetted as a village in 1880. The railway arrived in 1888, allowing local production to increase and a butter factory was established in 1895.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Nathalia_Murray_Valley_Highway_Park.JPG","Barmah.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Nathalia_Murray_Valley_Highway_Park.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Barmah_Forest_Heritage_Centre.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Australia_Victoria_Moira_Shire_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg']",

The suburb is located between the Tullamarine Freeway and Mount Alexander Road, south of Ormond Road, however some of this area is still incorrectly referred to as Ascot Vale. Travancore was initially supposed to encompass the entirety of the area flanked by Ormond and Mount Alexander Rds and the Tullamarine Freeway.
Travancore takes its name from the Travancore Mansion and Estate, a property owned by Henry Madden. Madden purchased the property, previously Flemington House, from the relatives of Hugh Glass in 1906 and renamed the property. Henry exported horses to India (hence the property is named after the Indian state of Travancore). When the land around Travancore Mansion was sub-divided, many of the streets were named in keeping with the Indian theme, such as Lucknow Street, Bengal Street, Cashmere Street and Mangalore Street. Many of the houses reflect the Old English architecture of the former Travancore region of India in the state of Kerala.
The Travancore Mansion was purchased by the Victorian Government and became a special education school. The original Flemington House/Travancore Mansion was demolished in the 1940s. The area is now occupied by Travancore Mental Health Service.
Travancore, only 5 km from Melbourne's CBD, has seen a transformation in recent years following a fire that destroyed the Lombard Paper Factory.

It is home to many cultural institutions including the Theatre Royal, the oldest continuously operating theatre in mainland Australia.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/CastlemaineStation.JPG","Castlemaine.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/CastlemaineStation.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/CastlemaineArtGallery.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Castlemaine_from_burke_and_wills_memorial_lookout.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/CastlemaineHarryLawsonBust.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/CastlemainePostOffice.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Mount_Alexander_Diggings.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/CastlemaineTownHall.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Forest_Creek_%28Castlemaine%2C_Victoria%29_1852.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Barker_street_castlemaine_1908.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Chinese_leaving_for_the_diggings._Cobb_%26_Co._coach%2C_Castlemaine..jpeg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Australia_Victoria_Mount_Alexander_Shire_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg']",

"Great Western","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western,_Victoria","Great Western is a town in the east of the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. The town is located on the Western Highway, in the Shire of Northern Grampians local government area, 225 kilometres north west of the state capital, Melbourne. The town has a population of 644.
The first European settlers in the Great Western area were sheep graziers in the 1840s and closer settlement began with the discovery of gold during the Victorian gold rush, the Post Office opening on 1 June 1858. . The first vineyards in the Great Western area were established by two Frenchmen who met at the gold diggings at Daylesford. Following their example, Joseph Best and his brother Henry established vineyards in 1865. Following Joseph's death in 1888, the property was purchased by Hans Irvine. Irvine imported staff from France and dedicated himself to establishing a sparkling wine of comparable quality of French champagne. In 1918, Irvine sold the winery to his friend and Australian wine pioneer, Benno Seppelt.
Today, Great Western is still producing quality sparkling wines including Seppelt Salinger at the Seppelt winery, now owned by Treasury Wine Estates. The Seppelt cellars include over 3 kilometres of labyrinthine tunnels (""drives"") originally constructed by miners searching for gold and are now used to allow the sparkling wine to rest and develop. The other major vineyard in the area is the Concongella vineyard, operated by Best's Wines, producing a wide variety of wine types. Table shiraz, including some from pre-phylloxera root stocks, is also produced by wineries in the area. The development of a water recycling program transferring waste water from nearby Ararat to wineries at Great Western has allowed recent expansion of the wine industry in the area.
The horse racing club, the Wimmera Racing Club, holds the Great Western Cup meeting on Australia Day (26 January), and a rodeo is also held annually.
The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mininera & District Football League.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Great_Western_War_Memorial.JPG","Great Western.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Great_Western_War_Memorial.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Great_Western_Anglican_Church.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Great_Western_Hotel.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Great_Western_General_Store.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Great_Western_Church_002.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Great_Western_Mechanics_Institute.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/GreatWesternMainStreet.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Great_Western_Western_Highway.JPG', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Australia_Victoria_Northern_Grampians_Shire_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg']",
"Halls Gap","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross","The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry ""in the face of the enemy"" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.
The VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War. Since then, the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients. Only 15 medals, 11 to members of the British Army, and four to the Australian Army, have been awarded since the Second World War. The traditional explanation of the source of the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. Some research suggested a variety of origins for the material actually making up the medals themselves. Research has established that the metal for the medals came from two Chinese cannons that were captured from the Russians in 1855.
Owing to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal has fetched over £400,000 at auction. A number of public and private collections are devoted to the Victoria Cross. The private collection of Lord Ashcroft, amassed since 1986, contains over one-tenth of all VCs awarded. Following a 2008 donation to the Imperial War Museum, the Ashcroft collection went on public display alongside the museum's Victoria and George Cross collection in November 2010.
Beginning with the Centennial of Confederation in 1967, Canada followed in 1975 by Australia and New Zealand developed their own national honours systems, separate and independent of the British or Imperial honours system. As each country's system evolved, operational gallantry awards were developed with the premier award of each system, the VC for Australia, the Canadian VC and the VC for New Zealand being created and named in honour of the Victoria Cross. These are unique awards of each honours system, recommended, assessed, gazetted and presented by each country.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Ribbon_-_Medalje_vir_Troue_Diens.gif","Halls

Southbank's southern and western borders are bounded by Dorcas Street, Kings Way, the West Gate Freeway and Montague Street.
Southbank was formerly an industrial area and part of South Melbourne. It was transformed into a densely populated district of high rise apartment and office buildings beginning in the early 1990s, as part of an urban renewal program. With the exceptions of the cultural precinct along St Kilda Road, few buildings built before this time were spared by redevelopment.
Today, Southbank is dominated by high-rise development. It is one of the primary business centres in Greater Melbourne, being the headquarters of Treasury Wine Estates, Crown Limited, Alumina, Incitec Pivot, The Herald and Weekly Times (including the Herald Sun), as well as regional offices of many major corporations, in a cluster of towers with over 340,000 square metres of office space in 2008. It is also one of the most densely populated areas of Melbourne, with a large cluster of apartment towers, including Australia's tallest tower measured to its highest floor, the Eureka Tower.
Southbank Promenade and Southgate Restaurant and Shopping Precinct, on the southern bank of the Yarra River, extending to Crown Casino, is one of Melbourne's major entertainment precincts. Southgate's landmark Ophelia sculpture by Deborah Halpern has been used to represent Melbourne in tourism campaigns.

Covering only about a square kilometre, until 1999 Cremorne existed only as a locality in the larger suburb of Richmond. Cremorne's charm is in its rather chaotic mix of uses and the unique character resulting from being 'walled in' by main roads and railways on all sides. There are industrial icons such as Bryant and May, Rosella and the Nylex Clock, side by side with Victorian cottages, modern townhouses, offices and light industries.
Cremorne takes its name from the Cremorne Gardens, an amusement park which occupied a riverfront location in the western half of Cremorne for a period in the mid 19th century.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Shops_on_church_street_richmond.jpg","Cremorne.jpg","Done","['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Shops_on_church_street_richmond.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/31/Cremorne_gardens_in_1862.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Australia_Victoria_metropolitan_Melbourne_location_map.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Red_pog.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg']",

"Cambarville","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambarville,_Victoria","Cambarville is a bounded rural locality in Victoria, Australia. Much of its area is part of the Yarra Ranges National Park. Its Local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges.
It is notable for its giant mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) trees within the Cumberland Memorial Scenic Reserve, and relics from former sawmills and gold mining. The Big Culvert is located nearby on the Marysville - Woods Point Road, which was historically part of the Yarra Track.
Cambarville was established as a timber mill town in the 1940s. Timber mill owners A Cameron and FJ Barton named Cambarville. They established the mill to salvage timber from trees destroyed in the 1939 bushfires.
It had a one-teacher primary school, which opened on February 2, 1943, closed in 1945 due to lack of pupils, re-opened again in 1946, and shut down for the last time in 1968. The main classroom was used as a community hub for various social activities, like plays, concerts, and dances. Life in Cambarville was said to be particularly difficult, with no access to luxuries like refrigeration and other electrical appliances. Single men were housed in huts provided by the logging company, and were provided with meals from a boarding house on Main Street (sometimes there were more itinerants and single men living in Cambarville than families with children). Main Street was never sealed during its heyday. The main saw mill was destroyed twice by fire, the last time in 1971. The town's population rapidly dwindled after the mill's closure. (All information gleaned from display boards dotted around Main Street, installed by Parks Victoria).
On the night of 3 April 1961, Eric Wilkinson, a keen, young naturalist, saw a Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) whilst conducting night surveys near Cambarville. A few hours later, he saw another one. The Museum of Victoria subsequently confirmed the authenticity of Eric Wilkinson's findings, which proved to be extraordinarily significant, considering that the last confirmed sighting of this elusive marsupial was documented back in 1909, and that the species had been declared extinct in 1921. In 1971, the Leadbeater's possum was proclaimed by the Victorian Government as the state's faunal emblem. A mountain ash tree was planted on Main Street, Cambarville, on 3 April 2011, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the rediscovery of this much-sought after species. (All information derived from a metal plague and display board installed by Parks Victoria in close proximity to the commemorative tree on Main Street).
Cambarville was impacted by the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, and was the location of the death of the only firefighter killed during the fires. David Balfour, 47, from Gilmore, ACT, was killed on the night of 17 February when a burnt-out 50 m (160 ft) mountain ash tree fell on him while he was attaching a hose to a fire tanker.
